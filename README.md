# Component Behavior DSL

This project provides an MPS language for adding behavior described in terms of the [algorithmdsl](https://github.com/rosym-project/algorithm-dsl "algorithm DSL") to components described using the [compnentdsl](https://github.com/rosym-project/component-dsl "compnent DSL").
The project also includes a code generator that produces C++ code for OROCOS components implementing the specified behavior.
